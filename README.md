# multispectral

This is a convenience package for basic operations on multispectral images that exist as a bunch of 
files in folders. Makes your lif easy with regular expressions.

**CAUTION: very prototypy at the moment, would not recommend use.. yet :)**

##current features:
* easy data handling with "Frames" and regular expressions
* deformable fine registration using [elastix](http://elastix.isi.uu.nl/)
* decomposition/clustering using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

##requirements:
* opencv-python
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* [SimpleElastix](https://pypi.org/project/SimpleElastix/) **WARNING: THIS WILL NOT BE ENFORCED BY pip**

##usage:

Suppose you have your multispectral layers in a folder `'/somepath/codexX-pageY'` 
(or any of its subfolders), and the files look something like:
`'codexX-pageY_400nm.tif', 'codexX-pageY_500nm.tif',...`

Then you could go:
```python
from multispectral import Frame,Layer,Registration,Unmixing

# collect images in root_dir matching regex; groups 1 and 2 of the match object 
# identify the document and the layer respectively (optional)
frame = Frame(root_dir='/somepath/codexX-pageY',
                regex='(.+-.+)_(\d{3}nm).tif',
                group_framename=1,
                group_layername=2)
                
# inter-register all layers (regex_ref defines the fixed 'reference image',
# store the result in a given output folder (or by default frame.root_dir/registered_fine),
# and return a frame containing those resulting images
registered = Registration.register_fine(frame=frame, regex_ref='500nm')

# make unmixing object: loads images of frame and converts them to a data matrix
um = Unmixing(registered)
# perform principal component analysis, store visualizations of first 5 components
# in given output folder (or by default frame.root_dir/pca), return frame containing those
principal_components = um.unmix(method=Unmixing.Method.PCA, n_components=5, p_keep=0.5)
```

Simple as that.
